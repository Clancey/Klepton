// kl_avdec — the host video decoder behind UE4's Java media player.
//
// The split is kl_opensl/kl_audio's and kl_mediandk/kl_vtdec's, one API family
// over: `com.epicgames.ue4.MediaPlayer14` in kl_jni.c is the GUEST's contract
// and knows nothing about how a frame is produced; this is the device, and it
// knows nothing about Java. It is what lets the decode be exercised without a
// guest at all.
//
// Why not kl_vtdec, which already decodes HEVC: that one takes an **Annex-B
// elementary stream** the guest has already demuxed (Steam Link's wire format).
// RE4's cutscenes are H.265 in an **MP4 container** — four of them, `Stored`
// (so uncompressed, a plain byte range) inside `main.203.com.Armature.VR4.obb`,
// the largest being `VR4/Content/Movies/Andy/bio4_opening_h265.mp4`. Demuxing
// MP4 by hand to feed a decoder we already have would be more code than asking
// AVFoundation to do both, and it would be code with no other caller.
//
// Everything the guest can ask for is answered from a real decode or refused;
// nothing here fabricates a duration, a size or a frame. A media file we cannot
// open answers `kl_avdec_open` NULL, which is what the guest's own
// `setDataSource -> false` path is for.
